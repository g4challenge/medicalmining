#Abstract

#Introduction
The information about diseases found online can be investigated and analyzed to create new insights.

But the content is human readable in an online board, where people are disscussing their sickness and others share their knowledge or story and give recommendations. 

The challenge is to analyze the free text in a way to use the huge amount of data further on.

The Goal of this paper is to show the process of collecting the information, finding the models, and look at the topic modelled result.

The use of meta data like author, date, can show connections between topics and authors, as well as the relation between the documents.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
