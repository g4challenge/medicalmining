abstract = {Topic models allow the probabilistic modeling of term frequency occurrences in doc- uments. The tted model can be used to estimate the similarity between documents as well as between a set of speci ed keywords using an additional layer of latent variables which are referred to as topics. The R package topicmodels provides basic infrastructure for tting topic models based on data structures from the text mining package tm. The package includes interfaces to two algorithms for tting topic models: the variational expectation-maximization algorithm provided by David M. Blei and co-authors and an algorithm using Gibbs sampling by Xuan-Hieu Phan and co-authors.},
